The design follows an American framework, creating a unique and inviting home atmosphere. A soft cream color serves as the backdrop, complemented by walnut wood furniture and decor, which imbue the space with a rich vintage character. Antique furnishings and accents further enhance the nostalgic, timeworn elegance within the American-inspired design. The living roomâ€™s feature wall employs simple yet striking symmetry, with a classic fireplace flanked by decorative, symmetrical doors.
