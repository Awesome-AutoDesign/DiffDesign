The wooden flooring in the living room extends seamlessly into the balcony, enhancing spatial flow. The sofa area, enclosed by a shoe cabinet and the balcony opening, creates an intimate, cocoon-like space. Electric recliners and potted plants contribute to comfort, while a decorative screen adds visual interest. A 65-inch TV is mounted on the opposite wall, complemented by a vintage-style TV cabinet. Seasonal decorations are thoughtfully incorporated to subtly alter the atmosphere, creating a dynamic and inviting environment throughout the year.
