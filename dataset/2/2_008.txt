Corridors, bridges, and landscapes form an integrated visual experience. From the small volume resulting from the partial collapse of the main courtyard's roof, guests can pass alongside the wall of the smaller courtyard and enter the interior through an archway. One side of the corridor bridge facing the lake is lined with floor-to-ceiling glass, offering unobstructed views. In contrast, the hill-facing side features an irregular arrangement of three types of slender columns—mirrored, frosted, and transparent—creating a dynamic interplay of reflections and refractions. This design allows filtered sunlight to produce enchanting patterns of light and shadow, enriching the sensory experience.
