A custom stone fountain enhances the courtyard, with the soothing sound of flowing water enriching the sensory experience of tea drinking. The designer intentionally lowered the terrace floor to extend the courtyard outdoors, achieving visual permeability between the courtyard and the street, as well as a seamless integration of interior and exterior landscapes. The streamlined arrangement of greenery fosters a tranquil garden atmosphere, inviting patrons to enjoy sunlight while providing shaded seating beneath the trees.
