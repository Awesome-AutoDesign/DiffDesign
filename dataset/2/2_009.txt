The design process prioritized the site's natural elements, ensuring the preservation of all large trees while thoughtfully adjusting both the building and landscape layouts to accommodate their existing positions. Additionally, a series of landscaped terraces and sloped roofs were strategically incorporated to optimize landscape utilization, offering guests diverse visual experiences and enhanced opportunities to connect with nature. This careful integration fosters a harmonious relationship between the built environment and the natural surroundings, enriching the overall aesthetic and functional appeal of the space.
