Made of recycled concrete, the teahouse’s curved roof consists of two concave surfaces that slope from north to south. The teahouse is located at the center of an oval pond, around which water flows gracefully thanks to the site’s topographical changes. The triangular teak latticework on the north facade effectively blocks the strong northeast winds while allowing for diffused sunlight. Complementing this design, three pivoting teak doors on the other facades optimize sunlight control and accessibility. This careful integration of materials not only creates charming shades but also builds a comfortable environment for visitors. Overall, the design reconciles sustainability with aesthetic appeal, providing a tranquil space for tea tasting amidst a natural landscape.
