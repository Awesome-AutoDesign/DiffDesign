The centrally located entrance offers clear pathways for customers and allows observation of the seating arrangement, enhancing circulation efficiency. The inward-opening door expands the entrance display area and outdoor space. The design emphasizes the bar area, utilizing geometric shapes to disrupt the rigidity of the existing glass curtain wall. Spatial divisions are clearly defined, with varied seating arrangements that accommodate different group sizes and preferences for privacy or openness. High-backed booths separate the passageway while concealing the kitchenâ€™s service area, distinguishing this design from traditional wall forms and fostering a more cohesive and unified environment.
