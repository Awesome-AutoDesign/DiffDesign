This design departs from traditional dining layouts by integrating straight lines and curves to create a mysterious spatial experience that enhances diners' enjoyment. A central circular area radiates outward in layers, forming a semi-open dining space that complements the open dining area, satisfying the need for an immersive experience while maximizing privacy. The placement of greenery in central and main passage areas acts as a focal point, offering a comfortable dining environment that provides visual separation and enhances both comfort and spatial depth.
