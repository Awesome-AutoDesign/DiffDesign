Wooden crates and plants envelop the restaurant, with a cantilevered entrance and stacked crates blurring the boundaries between indoor and outdoor spaces. All materials retain their natural colors, where the rough concrete texture contrasts with refined metal components. The lightweight rusticity of solid wood and corrugated panels creates balance, eschewing decorative excess to present food in its authentic form, reminiscent of simple, rustic fare. Market-style carts brimming with food, beverage-selling windows, and casual wall graffiti enhance a vibrant atmosphere, soothing the fatigue of everyday life.
