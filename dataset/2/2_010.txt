The design employs materials in gray tones that echo the nearby mountains, while sloped roofs mimic the terrain's contours. To harmonize with the village, brick walls typical of the area are utilized, and the layout adopts a courtyard arrangement characteristic of local architecture. The ground floor features a spatial organization based on traditional courtyard designs, consisting of four north-south courtyards and three east-west courtyards. These are categorized into distinct areas: a ceremonial courtyard, a viewing courtyard, a recreational courtyard, a planting courtyard, a transportation courtyard, and a utility courtyard. Each yard varies in size and shape, intentionally avoiding axial alignment to enhance spatial dynamics.
