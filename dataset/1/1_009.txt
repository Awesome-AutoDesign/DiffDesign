The designer creates a "skeleton" interior by eliminating corridors, resulting in a semi-open space for employees. The wall construction aligns with architectural modules, enhancing depth and allowing observation from multiple angles while eliminating dead-end circulation. This design harmonizes functionality and aesthetics, yielding a clean appearance. Areas around the windows are deepened and lined with grainy matte teak, adding warmth and diffusing direct sunlight; the same wood wraps the walls, floors, and doors. Lush green plants introduce organic elements, connecting the urban environment with nature, while tree shadows enhance comfort. The organic shapes further reduce tension and promote a relaxing atmosphere.
