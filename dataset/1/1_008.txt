This project experiments with color and compositional solutions, with the harmonious color palette reflecting the core design concept. The office is organized into distinct volumes, each identified by specific colors: the core area, meeting rooms, and offices are in mint green; separate green volumes enhance the design; the workspace is blue; the meeting room is red; and the tea area combines red and blue. The main workspace is defined by plywood shelving units featuring plants. Furthermore, the geometric patterns of the multicolored carpets throughout the office are instrumental in shaping the interior and emphasizing the spatial layout. These design techniques successfully integrate functionality, efficiency, and aesthetics.
