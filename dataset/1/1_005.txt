By utilizing space from multiple directions, a new sense of "proximity" is established among individuals, differentiating it from traditional office environments. For example, colleagues working side by side are unaffected by variations in eye levels, while those seated apart may feel a connection when their eyes meet. This design creates a variety of spaces, including enclosed areas that evoke safety and open areas that provide a panoramic view, enabling individuals to choose settings that best meet their needs. Depending on the horizon line, these elements—floors, benches, or tables—serve multiple functions. This unique scale enhances flexibility and redefines office space, extending beyond conventional purposes.
