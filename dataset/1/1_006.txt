The building's "colorful" industrial design fulfills its technical mission in various ways. On one floor, a perforated metal structure called "Clouds" creates a bright, transparent meeting space that appears to float, offering an ideal setting for quick, informal gatherings. With minimal ceiling height, the space reveals the building's technical structure, framed by an intricate LED linear lighting grid. Numerous small rooms and corridors enhance the sense of spaciousness and vibrancy in the open area, while colorful partition structures guide and engage occupants.
