The design preserves original features, utilizing a concrete structure that complements large windows with stunning views. Three expansive windows enhance sightlines, and an adjacent tea and lounge area allows for scenic enjoyment. Three meeting rooms and phone booths meet work requirements, while air conditioning, lighting, and fire safety systems are strategically distributed in open areas. Independent zones with low ceilings and soundproof walls create distinct volumes. Centrally located workstations ensure easy access, and spacious, multifunctional sofas and small lounges foster social interaction. Paulistano armchairs and side tables contribute to the overall aesthetic appeal of the space.
