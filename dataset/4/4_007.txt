The store's considerable depth is complemented by semi-enclosed "house" volumes, which create private spaces while balancing the overall composition through spatial relationships. The interplay between varying spatial scales, landmarks, and the foreground-background dynamic enhances the richness of the experience. The site's original architectural elements, including two massive concrete columns and high, exposed concrete slabs, dominate the space, adding a strong structural presence.
