In engaging with historical architecture, the designer highlights the contrast between old and new. The newly added walls feature curved forms, creating a striking juxtaposition with the original orthogonal walls. These new walls are designed with a streamlined, clean aesthetic, while the old walls maintain their rich textures. The historically significant stone columns stand like sculptures against the smooth, curved backdrop. The walls are painted in soft, neutral colors, and when warm sunlight filters onto the white surfaces, the dining space is bathed in a gentle, inviting ambiance.
