The two box-like structures are designed to evoke the shape of the moon, with distinct concave spaces resulting from their interaction with a large sphere. The building on the right features an enticing balcony, while the left incorporates horizontal slits. Smaller spherical indentations on the other edges add depth and openings to the design. These irregular forms, arising from the sphereâ€™s impact, are integrated into the architecture, creating protruding spaces. The rooftop hosts an outdoor garden surrounded by high walls, with a circular opening enhancing transparency. A small, temple-like dome is positioned atop the building. On the third floor, independent walls are adorned with constellation maps, each personalized to reflect the client's astrological sign.
