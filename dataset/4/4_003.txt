The design arranges five circular elements horizontally, which are then stretched in three dimensions. This integration of internal and external spaces results in a distinctive first-floor facade, with interlocking rings. Arched glass panels enclose the interior, and the recessed, softened ceiling balances the facade's lightweight, translucent quality, enhancing spatial stability. The primary color scheme of light gray and natural wood tones is complemented by wave-shaped pendant lights, whose curves mimic the dynamic motion of the sea, echoing the flowing design of the bar area.
