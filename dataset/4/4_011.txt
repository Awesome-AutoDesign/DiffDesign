The design draws inspiration from traditional Eastern garden rhythms, creating a comfortable and serene open space that encourages interaction and engagement. Deeply rooted columns and pillars support the core of the space, while symmetrical vertical lines enhance the flow and illuminate otherwise dull moments. Traditional Eastern elements are thoughtfully integrated to evoke a sense of comfort and tranquility. The café’s atmosphere is shaped by natural materials, such as rough granite columns, which ensure both functional and aesthetic harmony. Semi-transparent fabric partitions are carefully arranged, subtly reconfiguring the space to enhance its fluidity.
