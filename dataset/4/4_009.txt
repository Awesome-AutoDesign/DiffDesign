The Anaya Café, with its distinctive "hat" design, is situated within Anaya Park, forming a smooth, arcuate connection with the building’s fluid lines. Inspired by the gentle sea breeze, the design emphasizes simplicity and the creation of a serene, resort-like atmosphere. The café’s steel roof structure is complemented by side glass panels that protect against wind and rain. The central space is centered around an inner courtyard, supported by steel columns, ensuring a transparent, clean, and comfortable environment. The interplay of natural light throughout the day offers guests diverse sensory experiences, while the illuminated curved roof at night appears to float in the breeze, enhancing the café's ethereal presence.
