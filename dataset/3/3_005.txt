The design employs soft, muted tones to emphasize an ink wash aesthetic, creating a unified and harmonious overall image. The central concept draws inspiration from the idea of "rivers and lakes," effectively blending Anhui's rich cultural heritage with the surrounding natural landscape. Key elements of the design are influenced by the region's iconic Huizhou architecture, traditional landscape paintings, and the intricate patterns found in window lattices. These elements are thoughtfully reinterpreted, integrated, and transformed to create a modern yet culturally resonant space that fosters a deeper connection with nature and tradition.
