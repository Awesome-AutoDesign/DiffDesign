The spatial arrangements in these areas are designed to evoke a sense of ritual, transcending everyday life. This concept extends beyond the individual boxes, positioning them within a larger context that links the interior to the exterior. Rather than isolating these elements, the design reflects a composite dimension that moves vertically, shifting between levels. While the horizontal plane represents daily routines, the interwoven vertical planes create a more complex, three-dimensional space, fostering new possibilities.
