The design incorporates a blue-gray color palette, enhanced by warm brown wooden panels and soft golden lighting, to establish a retro yet sophisticated atmosphere. The lighting is strategically positioned above the dining tables, ensuring a well-lit, bright, and comfortable dining experience. The self-service counter, with its light gray and white tones, is illuminated by softer, brighter lighting, effectively highlighting the food presentation and improving customer visibility. This thoughtful combination of materials and lighting not only enhances the visual appeal but also contributes to the overall dining ambiance, providing a refined yet inviting environment.
