The hotel front desk is designed with a central black square backdrop, framed by marble and wood paneling. Symmetrical and repetitive elements draw the eye toward the black focal point, establishing the desk as the visual center. The overall style, inspired by the idea of "small hidden in the forest, large hidden in the city," is understated, serene, and elegant. The color palette of ivory white, natural wood, and gray, accented with touches of black, fosters a calm and tranquil atmosphere.
