The design repurposes a room that originally lacked a courtyard by intentionally incorporating one, creating a more open, connected space. The residence is no longer enclosed, with the interior flowing into the exterior, and the courtyards are linked to maintain the spirit of traditional Suzhou gardens. The former parking area has been transformed into a gravel courtyard and a water courtyard, complemented by a cast-in-place concrete wall textured with bamboo patterns. The sunken seating within the pool provides a closer connection to the water and trees, offering visitors a fresh perspective and immersive experience.
