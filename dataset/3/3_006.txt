The design draws inspiration from the concept of Jiangnan gardens, creating a "Peach Blossom Land within the city" to bring tranquility and serenity amidst the urban bustle. By blending the narrative richness of Eastern art with the cultural diversity of Shanghai, the design harmonizes functionality and aesthetics to evoke a distinct oriental atmosphere. The hotel's color palette, drawn from traditional paintings, complements the carefully selected materials that highlight Eastern refinement. Every detail is meticulously designed, ensuring a seamless integration of quality, style, and cultural authenticity. Elements like the entrance screen, niches, doors, and mini-bars reflect the core of Eastern design principles, both in materials and form.
